///
/// a naive approach would look like this:
///
/// ```ignore
/// let view: MemoryView<u8> = ctx.memory(0).view();
/// unsafe {
///       std::ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(
///         slice.as_ptr(),
///         view.as_ptr().add(guest_ptr as usize) as *mut u8,
///         slice.len(),
///     );
/// }
/// ```
///
/// the guest memory is part of the host memory, so we get the host's pointer to the start of the
/// guest's memory with view.as_ptr() then we add the guest's pointer to where it wants to see the
/// written bytes then copy the slice directly across.
///
/// the problem with this approach is that the guest_ptr typically needs to be provided by the
/// allocator in the guest wasm in order to be safe for the guest's consumption, but a malicious
/// guest could provide bogus guest_ptr values that point outside the bounds of the guest memory.
/// the naive host would then corrupt its own memory by copying bytes... wherever, basically.
///
/// a better approach is to use wasmer's WasmPtr abstraction, which checks against the memory
/// bounds of the guest based on the input type and can be dereferenced to a [Cell] slice that we
/// can write to more safely.
///
/// @see https://docs.rs/wasmer-runtime-core/0.17.0/src/wasmer_runtime_core/memory/ptr.rs.html#120
///
/// this is still not completely safe in the face of shared memory and threads, etc.
///
/// the guest needs to provide a pointer to a pre-allocated (e.g. by forgetting a Vec<u8>) region
/// of the guest's memory that it is safe for the host to write to.
///
/// it is the host's responsibility to tell the guest the length of the allocation that is needed
/// and the guest's responsibility to correctly reserve an allocation to be written into.
///
/// write_bytes() takes a slice of bytes and writes it to the position at the guest pointer
///
/// as the byte slice cannot be co-ordinated by the compiler (because the host and guest have
/// different compilers and allocators) we prefix the allocation with a WasmSize length value.
///
/// for example, if we wanted to write the slice &[1, 2, 3] then we'd take the length of the slice,
/// 3 as a WasmSize, which is u32, i.e. a 3_u32 and convert it to an array of u8 bytes as
/// [ 3_u8, 0_u8, 0_u8, 0_u8 ] and concatenate it to our original [ 1_u8, 2_u8, 3_u8 ].
/// this gives the full array of bytes to write as:
///
/// ```ignore
/// [ 3_u8, 0_u8, 0_u8, 0_u8, 1_u8, 2_u8, 3_u8 ]
/// ```
///
/// this allows us to read back the byte slice given only a GuestPtr because the read operation
/// can do the inverse in a single step by reading the length inline
///
/// it also requires the host and the guest to both adopt this convention and read/write the
/// additional 4 byte prefix in order to read/write the real payload correctly
///
